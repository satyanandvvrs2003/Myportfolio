    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome!
I am Satyanand Kumar, a passionate, self-taught web developer and creative thinker from Deoghar, Jharkhand, India. My journey into web development is not just a technical story ‚Äî it is an emotional one, full of learning, struggle, dedication, and dreams. With a humble beginning and strong determination, I have transformed my passion for technology into a growing skillset, driven by a purpose: to build meaningful, beautiful, and useful digital experiences for people.
</p><br>
<p>
Despite the challenges of working without a computer and learning everything on a mobile phone, I have never let limitations define my path. With immense patience and self-discipline, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and went on to create complete, real-world web projects ‚Äî including a full-fledged, professional school website for New Holy Child Public School, which includes a working photo/video gallery, auto-updating notice board, admin backend system through Google Sheets, and an interactive, mobile-friendly design.</p><br>
<p>
Each project I build reflects my values: simplicity, beauty, accessibility, and impact. I don‚Äôt just write code ‚Äî I craft experiences. I ensure my designs are clean, responsive, and user-friendly. From layouts to logic, from animations to accessibility ‚Äî I handle every detail with care and creativity.</p><br>
<p>
I am currently focused on learning backend technologies, dynamic data handling, and app development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, mastering tools like Java, Firebase, Node.js, and Flutter to build not only static sites but complete, real-time web and mobile applications.</p><br>

<p>But beyond all technologies, what truly defines me is my mindset.</p><br>
<p>I believe in:
</p><br>
<p>Learning continuously, no matter the circumstances</p><br>

<p>Creating with love and purpose</p><br>

<p>Helping others grow by sharing what I learn</p><br>

<p>Never giving up, even when the journey is difficult</p><br>
</p>
<p>
In addition to being a developer, I also work as a music teacher and hostel superintendent, where I manage students with compassion and discipline. These roles have given me real-life experience in leadership, responsibility, and patience ‚Äî which directly help me stay grounded and focused as a developer.</p><br>
<p>
I am always open to collaborations, freelance projects, school or education-based digital solutions, and long-term partnerships. If you‚Äôre looking for someone who truly cares about your project ‚Äî not just technically but emotionally too ‚Äî then I‚Äôd be honored to work with you.</p><br>
<p>
Let‚Äôs build something beautiful together.</p><br>
